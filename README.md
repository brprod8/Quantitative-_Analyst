`Quantitative Analyst` *for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios that’s both inexpensive and high quality. (Think about Wealthfront (Links to an external site.) or Betterment (Links to an external site.)). To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.* 
**You've been tasked** *with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. (People sometimes refer to these managers as whales because of the large amount of money that they manage). You’ll need to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key `risk-management metrics`: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.*

## Quantitative Analyst 📈💡

# STEP 1
 * Analyze the Performance   
 
 >👨🏿‍⚖️Analyze the data to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market, which is the S&P 500

 >👨🏿‍⚖️*This is 4 Fund Porfolio including  S&P500*

  WE can infer that `BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC` Fund porfolio performance is greater than    the other porfolio 

# STEP 2

* Analyze the Volatility

>👨🏿‍⚖️Analyze the volatility of each of the four fund portfolios and of the S&P 500 Index by using box plots.

>💡Most volatile is plot with the `greatest spread` Least volatile is plot with the `smallest spread`

# STEP 3
* Analyze the Risk
>👨🏿‍⚖️Evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio by using the [standard deviation](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-calculate-standard-deviation) and the [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)

 [Risk management and portfolio](https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/portfolio-diversification-definition-and-purpose/#:~:text=In%20finance%20and%20investment%20planning%2C%20portfolio%20diversification%20is,should%20include%20diversification%20rules%20that%20are%20strictly%20followed.) diversification are two key aims of quantitative analysis.Metrics like the variance, beta, and rolling beta, can be calculated per portfolios. The purpose will be to determine the volatility of the portfolios relative to the market, as represented by the S&P 500. By finding the beta, you’ll be able to assess the risk profile of each portfolio.
